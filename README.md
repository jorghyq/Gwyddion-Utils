# Gwyddion-Utils
This project provides a SPM data browser (like Nanonis Scan Inspector). It is based on Gwyddion, using the Gwyddion python API.
It can be used independently as GUI to browse SPM image data, or started as a
function in Gwyddion.
Its biggest advantage is the fast review of the SPM data and fast saving
function.
Currently, it can handle Nanonis .sxm file and Omicron .mtrx file.
